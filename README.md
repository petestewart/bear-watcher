This site is being created for the purpose of tracking brown bears in the Katmai National Park congregate along the Brooks River. It is being designed as a utility with scientists and park rangers in mind.

This project is an assignment as part of my course at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) to learn how to use Javascript modules.
